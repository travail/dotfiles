# dotfiles

Personal dotfiles for macOS.

## Requirements

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
- carton
- composer

## Installation

```sh
make
```

This will symlink all dotfiles to your home directory.

## Zsh Setup

### Zim

[Zim](https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw) is used as the zsh framework. It manages the following modules:

- `zsh-users/zsh-completions` — additional completion definitions
- `zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions` — fish-like history suggestions

After symlinking `zimrc` to `~/.zimrc`, install Zim:

```sh
ln -sf $(pwd)/zimrc ~/.zimrc
curl -fsSL --create-dirs -o ~/.zim/zimfw.zsh \
    https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw/releases/latest/download/zimfw.zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```

### fzf

[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is used for fuzzy searching.

Install via Homebrew and set up zsh integration:

```sh
brew install fzf
$(brew --prefix)/opt/fzf/install
```

When prompted, answer `y` to enable key bindings and fuzzy completion.

#### Key bindings
